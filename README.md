## WiseXpense - WealthTech platform (In Progress)

I am building a smart money management app that allow users to connect their bank accounts, load transactions, displaying charts, analyzing spending behaviours, automatic detect transactions and categorize them into defined buckets using AI. 


#Tech stack
- Backend: FastAPI for high performance and cloud/AI native (replacing spring boot), Go for Plaid API webhook (optional)
add cache(redis), message queue, log and monitoring, etc., deep in backend.
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn, react native (optional)
- Database: PostgreSQL 
- Infrastructure: Docker

I am deciding between self host or deploy on cloud. 

Thanks, stay tuned, this project will be finished soon!
