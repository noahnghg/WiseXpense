I am building a smart money management app that allow users to connect their bank accounts via Flink, automatic detect transactions and categorize them into buckets using AI. 

#Tech stack (planning)
- Backend: Spring Boot for business logic, FastAPI for machine learning inference, Go for Flink webhook 
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Flutter (optional)
- Database: PostgreSQL 
- Infrastructure: Docker 

I am deciding between self host or deploy on cloud. 

Thanks, stay tuned, this project will be finished soon!
